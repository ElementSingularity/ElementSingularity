            1. Delivery: these drones can be used for short-distance deliveries. <br/>
            2. Military: the military mostly use drones for spying and recon and sometimes even air-strikes. <br/>
            3. Emergency Rescue: in more severe/dangerous situations, it's better to send in a drone to rescue. <br/>
            4. Agriculture: many farmers use drones for a variety of tasks to reduce physical strain, like seeding crops. <br/>
            5. Wildlife Conservation: it's easier to track animal populations with an aerial view. It's also easier to drop a seed package to deforested land. <br/>
            6. Historical Conservation: drones are sent in to make a 3D map of historical sites, like Chernobyl. <br/>
            <br/>
            Special Case: for Delivery uses. I want to be able to go to other grocers easier since I don't have a bike or car yet.
